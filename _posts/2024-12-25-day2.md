### The TOGAF® ADM

![admphases](../assets/gitbook/images/MyScreenshot%202024-12-25%20at%202.02.57 PM.png)

- The ADM is a tested and repeatable process for developing architectures.
- All of these activities are carried out within an iterative cycle of continuous architecture definition and realization that allows organizations to transform their enterprises in a controlled manner in response to Business Goals and opportunities.

### ADM Phases Summary

- **The Preliminary Phase:** The preparation and initiation activities required to create an Architecture Capability including customization of the TOGAF framework and definition of Architecture Principles
- **Phase A: Architecture Vision:** The initial phase of an architecture development cycle It includes information about defining the scope of the architecture development initiative, identifying the stakeholders, creating the Architecture Vision, and obtaining approval to proceed with the architecture development.
- **Phase B: Business Architecture:** Development of a Business Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision
- **Phase C: Information Systems Architectures:** Development of Information Systems Architectures to support the agreed Architecture Vision
- **Phase D: Technology Architecture:** Development of the Technology Architecture to support the agreed Architecture Vision
- **Phase E: Opportunities & Solutions:** Initial implementation planning and the identification of delivery vehicles for the architecture defined in the previous phases
- **Phase F: Migration Planning:** How to move from the Baseline to the Target Architectures by finalizing a detailed Implementation and Migration Plan
- **Phase G: Implementation Governance:** Architectural oversight of the implementation
- **Phase H: Architecture Change Management:** Procedures for managing change to the new architecture
- **Requirements Management**: Operates the process of managing architecture requirements throughout the ADM

### ADM Phases

- The phases of the ADM cycle are further divided into steps, which are defined in the detailed description of each phase.
- The Requirements Management phase is a continuous phase that ensures that any changes to requirements are handled through appropriate governance processes and reflected in all other phases.

## "Draft" versus "Approved" Status

- In the ADM, documents which are under development and have not undergone any formal review and approval process are designated "draft".
- In the ADM, documents which have been reviewed and approved are designated "approved" in accordance with the organization's governance practices. Approved does not necessarily mean finalized.

## Iteration and the ADM

The ADM is iterative, over the whole process, between phases, and within phases.

- For each iteration of the ADM, a fresh decision must be taken as to:
- The breadth of coverage of the enterprise to be defined
- The level of detail to be defined
- The extent of the time period aimed at, including the number and extent of any intermediate time periods
- The architectural assets to be leveraged

## Essential Information Flows

- Information flows also result in iteration.
- Every time the Enterprise Architecture team is undertaking any activity within the scope of the
ADM it is executing a phase and developing the contents of the Enterprise Architecture
Landscape.
- The inter-dependent nature of developing a Target Architecture requires considering the entire architecture, resulting gaps, and resulting work to clear the gap simultaneously.

### Iteration via Information Flow

## Applying Iteration to the ADM

The ADM cycle is iterative. It is possible to cycle through phases or groups of phases several times looping back as needed.

## Governing the ADM

- The ADM is a key process to be managed in the same manner as other architecture artifacts.
- The Architecture Board should be satisfied that the method is being applied correctly across all phases of an architecture development iteration.
- Compliance with the ADM is fundamental to the governance of the architecture, to ensure that all considerations are made and all required deliverables are produced.

## Governing the Architecture

- The practitioner is directed to develop an architecture within a controlled scope.
- Within that controlled scope, the practitioner is directed to the stakeholder's preferences.
- The governance test will ask whether the practitioner is addressing the stakeholder's concerns.

## Governing Change

- Every Architecture Requirements Specification enables control of the implementation team.
- Design, implementation, and other change choices can be tested against the Architecture
Requirements Specification.
- The implementation team is directed to create changes with intentional value-based outcomes.
- Best practice governance enables the organization to control value realization.

## Why Constrain the Scope of Architectural Activity?

There are many reasons to constrain (or restrict) the scope of the architectural activity to be undertaken, most of which relate to limits in:

- The organizational authority of the team producing the architecture
- The objectives and stakeholder concerns to be addressed within the architecture
- The availability of people, finance, and other resources

## Scoping Dimensions

Typically, the scope of an architecture is first expressed in terms of breadth, depth, and time.
Once these dimensions are understood, a suitable combination of architecture domains can be selected that are appropriate to the problem being addressed.

### Dimensions: Breadth & Depth

**Breadth:** what is the full extent of the enterprise, and what part of that extent will this architecting effort deal with?

**Depth:** to what level of detail should the architecting effort go?

### Dimensions: Time Period and Architecture Domains

**Time Period:** what is the time period that needs to be articulated for the Architecture Vision, and does it make sense for the same period to be covered in the detailed Architecture Description?

**Architecture Domains:** a complete Enterprise Architecture Description should contain all four architecture domains (Business, Data, Application, Technology).

## Why Consider Architecture Alternatives?

- There is often more than one possible Target Architecture that would conform to the Architecture Vision, Architecture Principles, and Requirements.
- By identifying and considering alternative Target Architectures an understanding can be built of the different possibilities and trade-offs identified between the alternatives.
- Presenting different alternatives and trade-offs to stakeholders helps architects to extract hidden agendas, principles, and requirements that could impact the final Target Architecture.

## Architecture Alternatives Method

## Requirements Management - the Center of Architecture Development

- The TOGAF framework places requirements management and stakeholder engagement at the center of architecture development.
- Stakeholders own the architecture and the value preference and priority the architecture is expected to enable.
- Effective requirements management is dependent upon clear traceability from the organization's vision, mission, business model, and strategies through the most detailed statement of requirement.

## Information Flow and the TOGAF® ADM

- The TOGAF ADM is a logical method that places key activity steps together for the purpose of understanding relationship of activity and clarifying information flow.
- The graphic is a stylized path that demonstrates essential information flow.

### How Developing Architecture can be Applied to Support Agile Software Development

## The TOGAF® Standard Aligns to Agile Software Development in Phase G

- Architecture can be used to identify what products the enterprise needs, the boundary of the products, and what constraints a product owner has.
- Architecture can also be used to set of constraints that limit the choices of the Agile team.
- In Phase G (Implementation Governance) the practitioner serves the stakeholders guarding the mission, vision, goals, and investment roadmap.
